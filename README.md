Pico CI Tools
=============

This repository contains various scripts and tools for Pico's CI process.

Pico is a stupidly simple, blazing fast, flat file CMS. See http://picocms.org/ for more info.

We're using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com) to automate the build & release process of Pico - also called [continous integration or CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration). These scripts and tools are used by both Pico's core (i.e. [`picocms/Pico`](https://github.com/picocms/Pico)) and various official Pico plugins. Please refer to the ["Build & Release process" in Pico's main `CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/picocms/Pico/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details about what we're doing here. Besides, you'll also find info about how to contribute there.
